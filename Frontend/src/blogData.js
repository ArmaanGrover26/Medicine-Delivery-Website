    content: `
      <p>Type 2 diabetes is a chronic condition that affects how your body metabolizes sugar (glucose), your body's main source of fuel. With type 2 diabetes, your body either resists the effects of insulin — a hormone that regulates the movement of sugar into your cells — or doesn't produce enough insulin to maintain normal glucose levels.</p>
      <h3>Key Symptoms to Watch For</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Increased thirst and frequent urination</li>
        <li>Increased hunger</li>
        <li>Unintended weight loss</li>
        <li>Fatigue and irritability</li>
        <li>Blurred vision</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Managing type 2 diabetes includes a mix of lifestyle changes and medication. A healthy diet, regular physical activity, and maintaining a healthy weight are cornerstones of diabetes management.</p>

    content: `
      <p>Cardiovascular health becomes increasingly important as we age, especially after 40. The risk of heart disease rises significantly during this period, but with the right knowledge and preventive measures, you can maintain a healthy heart for years to come.</p>
      <h3>Understanding Cardiovascular Risk After 40</h3>
      <p>After age 40, several changes occur that increase cardiovascular risk:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Arterial stiffening:</strong> Blood vessels become less flexible</li>
        <li><strong>Cholesterol changes:</strong> LDL (bad) cholesterol may increase</li>
        <li><strong>Metabolism slows down:</strong> Leading to weight gain if lifestyle doesn't adjust</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Key Prevention Strategies</h3>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Regular Health Screenings:</strong> Blood pressure monitoring, cholesterol testing, and blood sugar levels are crucial.</li>
        <li><strong>Heart-Healthy Diet Focus on:</strong> Omega-3 rich foods, fiber-rich foods, and antioxidant-rich foods.</li>
        <li><strong>Regular Physical Activity:</strong> Aim for 150 minutes of moderate-intensity cardio exercise weekly.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>Remember, it's never too late to start taking care of your heart. Even small changes can have significant benefits for your cardiovascular health and overall well-being.</p>
